# Cache Eviction Policy Simulator

This project implements and compares multiple cache eviction policies
(LRU, FIFO, and Random) to study their hit/miss behavior under different
simulated memory access patterns.

## Implemented Policies
- Least Recently Used (LRU)
- First In First Out (FIFO)
- Random Eviction

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- O(1) cache operations using hash maps and linked lists
- Temporal locality and access patterns
- Cache eviction trade-offs in system design
- Performance comparison through simulation

## Project Goal
To analyze how different cache eviction strategies perform under varying
workloads and to demonstrate strong understanding of core data structures
and system-level design decisions.
